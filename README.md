## What's up? I'm Elif Kılıç  

I am a Research Data Analyst at the India Energy & Climate Center (IECC), University of California, Berkeley. My work combines climate science, data analysis, and open-source methods to understand and address the growing risks of extreme heat. I use Python and machine learning to create models and tools that can inform climate adaptation and public policy.  

I believe research must be reproducible, collaborative, and accessible—especially for communities in the Global South, who are too often excluded despite their knowledge and lived expertise being crucial to the work.

### Current Projects  

- **ClimaCoder ML Model (Independent Unfunded Project)**  
  An unaffiliated collaborative initiative to build machine learning models that project future heat extremes in Latin America. This project represents my commitment to open, community-driven science outside the walls of institutions.  

- **Heat Extreme ML Model (IECC, UC Berkeley)**  
  Developing a machine learning framework to identify and project extreme heat events across India, with direct applications for public health and climate adaptation planning.  

- **EHI-350\***  
  A modified Extended Heat Index that incorporates metabolic and solar heat loads. This work preceded my time at IECC and continues to evolve as part of my research at Berkeley.

I welcome collaboration with researchers, students, and practitioners. To me, open and just research is not optional—it is the foundation for building peer-reviewed knowledge that uplifts communities worldwide.
